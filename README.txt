Bluecap is an economic simulator developed for Australian resource
projects. The simulator's goal is to highlight regions of high
potential value in the early planning/exploration phase. Bluecap 
is designed to assist companies in focusing their efforts on regions 
more likely to generate commercially-viable projects. 

The simulator is a pre-scoping tool that uses coarse-level empirical
models to compare project prospects across large areas. Due to its 
broad scale, Bluecap lacks the detailed information necessary for 
full feasibility studies, and as such, it should not be
used as the sole basis for investment decisions.
