#   Required Modules
####################

Bluecap is written in Python2.7 and requires the following modules to run:
numpy; scipy; pylab or matplotlib; and the pint unit manager. 

All four can be installed with the python package manager: "pip".

# numpy
pip install numpy

# scipy
pip install scipy

# pylab/matplotlib 
pip install matplotlib

# pint unit manager
pip install pint


#   Running Bluecap
###################

Once the modules have been installed, Bluecap can be run from the command line as follows:

python /PATH/TO/bluecap/main.py -i ExampleInput.xml


#   Bluecap Alias
#################

To avoid the inconvenience of writing the full path each time, we recommend using an alias to run Bluecap. To do this, first open the ".bash_profile" file in your home directory, with a standard text editor, e.g. 

gedit ~/.bash_profile 

and append the following line to the file:

alias runBluecap="python /PATH/TO/bluecap/main.py"

Once this has been done, save the profile, and restart any open terminals to activate the alias.  Bluecap can now be called as follows:

runBluecap -i ExampleInput.xml
