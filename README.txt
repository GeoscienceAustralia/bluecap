Bluecap is an economic simulator developed for Australian mining
operations. The simulator's goal is to highlight regions of high
potential value for the purpose of mineral exploration. Bluecap is
designed to assist companies in focusing their efforts on regions
more likely to generate commercially-viable mining projects. 

The simulator is a  pre-scoping tool that uses coarse-level empirical
models to compare mining prospects across large areas. Due to its 
broad scale, Bluecap lacks the detailed information necessary for 
full feasibility studies, and as such, it should not be
used as the sole basis for investment decisions.
